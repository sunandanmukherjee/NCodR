# NCodR
Prediction model for non-coding RNA

## Dependencies
1. Python 3
2. Numpy 
3. Scikit learn
4. Pickle
5. Joblib

## Training 
        ./miRNA_prediction.py
        
Make sure that training data set is present in the working directory as "training_all.tsv"
This code will generate the model as "NCodR2_py3_rbf.pkl"
along with the plots of confusion matrices.
